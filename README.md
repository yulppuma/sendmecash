# sendmecash
## Originally made as a way to integrate a mom-pop shops business into the Web3 space. Features of sendmecash include, smart contract integration, wallet transactions, and transaction history. 
## While this solution is not final, its a rough draft on what could be in the near future. This also provides a way to test out web3 features incoporating MetaMask wallets, blockchain activities, and full-stack development using ethers.js for integration. Definitely a starting place for my web3 journey, but also not the last. Will most likely update this after exploring more of the web3 space. (DAO, Defi, NFTs, etc.)
